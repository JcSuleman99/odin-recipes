    <p>Hot Honey Pepperoni Pizza</p>
    <h3>Ingedients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup of Honey</li>
        <li>1 tbsp Dried chili Flakes</li>
        <li>1/2 tbsp Apple Cider Vinegar</li>
        <li>2 COBS Bread Pizza Bases</li>
        <li>1/2 cup Pizza sauce</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded Mozarella</li>
        <li>1 cup Pepperoni</li>
        <li>1/2 cup Hot Honey </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Pre-heat your oven to 425F</li>
        <li>Add your honey, chilli flakes, and apple cider vinegar to a pot and bring to a simmer over medium heat.</li>
        <li>As soon as you start to see bubbles, take the pot off the heat and let the chili flakes infuse with the
            honey for 5-10 minutes. The longer you let it infuse, the spicier it will be</li>
        <li>When ready, place a fine mesh sieve/strainer over a bowl or glass and pour the honey mixture into the sieve.
            This will strain the chili flakes from the hot honey. If you like spice you can add a few of the chili
            flakes back into the honey! Set this aside.</li>
        <li>Add pizza sauce to your COBS Bread Pizza Bases, then top with cheese (we like using a mozarella blend)</li>
        <li>Add pepperoni on top, then bake on a parchment-lined baking tray for 12-15 minutes, or until the cheese is
            nice and golden.</li>
        <li>Slice your pizza then drizzle with the hot honey and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
